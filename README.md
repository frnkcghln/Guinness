# Guinness

This is a github repository that I am using to keep python code related to a Neural Net that classifies pints of Guiness based on their quality. 

## Description

The repository contains the data scraping and cleaning files, as well at the model training code. They are stored here for my own use and reference. Some of the files are sources for Binder.org projects.

## Binder Projects
The Classifier is interactive and is available at this Binder link

## Blog
There are examples of the development of these models at [my blog](https://frankiecoughlan.data.blog).

## Use
Feel free to use the code as appropriate.
